## Keybinds for Common Commands

Rust keybinds let you run chat commands from a key instead of opening chat and typing them every time. This is useful for commands you press constantly, such as returning to the HUB, opening quests, opening shops, buying raid content, or calling a bike.

Open the F1 console and use this format:

```text
bind key chat.say "/command"
```

For commands without spaces, you can also use the shorter form:

```text
bind key chat.say /command
```

Use quotes when the command includes spaces, such as `/home base`.

The bind should work immediately. For binds you want to keep, Facepunch recommends running:

```text
writecfg
```

To remove a bind later, run:

```text
bind key ""
```

The example keys below are chosen to avoid common default movement, combat, map, voice, inventory, reload, crouch, sprint, and hotbar binds. If a key is already used on your setup, change the key name before running the bind.

For home binds, replace `base` with your actual home name, such as `/home 1` or `/home main`.

| Use | Command | Suggested key | Bind example | Remove this bind |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Return to HUB | `/hub` | Numpad `+` | `bind numpadplus chat.say /hub` | `bind numpadplus ""` |
| Teleport home | `/home <name>` | Numpad `-` | `bind numpadminus chat.say "/home base"` | `bind numpadminus ""` |
| Open quests | `/q` | Numpad `9` | `bind numpad9 chat.say /q` | `bind numpad9 ""` |
| Open Virtual Quarries | `/vq` | Numpad `6` | `bind numpad6 chat.say /vq` | `bind numpad6 ""` |
| Buy a raid base | `/buyraid` | Numpad `7` | `bind numpad7 chat.say /buyraid` | `bind numpad7 ""` |
| Buy a dungeon | `/buydungeon` | Numpad `8` | `bind numpad8 chat.say /buydungeon` | `bind numpad8 ""` |
| Open shop / stock market | `/s` | Comma | `bind comma chat.say /s` | `bind comma ""` |
| Call a free bike | `/toolazytowalk` | Left bracket | `bind leftbracket chat.say /toolazytowalk` | `bind leftbracket ""` |
| Open Skill Tree | `/st` | Right bracket | `bind rightbracket chat.say /st` | `bind rightbracket ""` |
| Accept teleport request | `/tpa` | Period | `bind period chat.say /tpa` | `bind period ""` |

### Smaller Keyboard Examples

If you do not have a numpad, use bracket, punctuation, or other unused keys instead. Replace only the key name:

```text
bind leftbracket chat.say /hub
bind rightbracket chat.say "/home base"
bind comma chat.say /s
bind period chat.say /tpa
```

Avoid replacing important default Rust keys unless you are sure you do not use them. For example, binding `q` to `/q` can be convenient, but it may overwrite a normal Rust bind on many setups.
